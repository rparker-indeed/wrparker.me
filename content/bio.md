My name is (William) Ryan Parker.  I typically go by my middle name, Ryan.  I
currently lead an engineering group at [Indeed][1] specializing in
financial product web applications.

I received my undergraduate degree from the [University of Central Arkanas][2],
majoring in [Chemistry][3] and minoring in [Computer Science][4].  I obtained my
master's degree from the [Brodbelt group][5] at the University of Texas at Austin.
There my work focused on identification of cystiene-containing peptides and
proteins via UVPD of chemical derivitaziation of chromophores.  A list of my peer-reviewed
publications from that can be found [here][7].
